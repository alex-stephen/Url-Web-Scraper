#URL Web Crawler - Shortest Path Finder Between two webpages.#

#This project is a sophisticated URL web crawler developed in Python, designed to find the shortest path between two web pages. Using BeautifulSoup, urllib, and requests
 for web scraping, combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, the crawler can efficiently navigate through large volumes of web data with precision.

#Technologies Used:
  - Language: Python
  - Libraries: BeautifulSoup, requests, urllib, os for web scraping and text parsing.
  - Programming Concepts: Web scraping, Machine Learning Algorithms, AI/ML-driven search optimization, Web parsing.

#Learning Objectives:
  - To practice and develop my programming skills in Python.
  - To expand my knowledge in the Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning field.
  - Use Python to automate and interact with web and web elements. 
  - Introduction to parsing large amounts of data in an efficient maner.
